⚠️ Unofficial Library - Use at Your Own Risk

This library uses undocumented Google APIs that can change without notice.

Not affiliated with Google - This is a community project
APIs may break - Google can change internal endpoints anytime
Rate limits apply - Heavy usage may be throttled
Best for prototypes, research, and personal projects. See Troubleshooting for debugging tips.
What You Can Build

🤖 AI Agent Tools - Integrate NotebookLM into Claude Code, or other LLM agents. Ships with Claude Code skills for natural language automation (notebooklm skill install), or build your own integrations with the async Python API.

📚 Research Automation - Bulk-import sources (URLs, PDFs, YouTube, Google Drive), run web research queries, and extract insights programmatically. Build repeatable research pipelines.

🎙️ Content Generation - Generate Audio Overviews (podcasts), videos, quizzes, flashcards, and study guides. Turn your sources into polished content with a single command.

Three Ways to Use

Method	Best For
Python API	Application integration, async workflows, custom pipelines
CLI	Shell scripts, quick tasks, CI/CD automation
Agent Skills	Claude Code, LLM agents, natural language automation

Quick Start


16-minute session compressed to 30 seconds

CLI

# 1. Authenticate (opens browser)
notebooklm login

# 2. Create a notebook
notebooklm create "My Research"
notebooklm use <notebook_id>

# 3. Add sources
notebooklm source add "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"
notebooklm source add "./paper.pdf"

# 4. Chat
notebooklm ask "What are the key themes?"

# 5. Generate a podcast
notebooklm generate audio --wait
notebooklm download audio ./podcast.mp3
Python API

import asyncio
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient

async def main():
    async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
        # List notebooks
        notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()

        # Create notebook and add source
        nb = await client.notebooks.create("Research")
        await client.sources.add_url(nb.id, "https://example.com")

        # Chat
        result = await client.chat.ask(nb.id, "Summarize this")
        print(result.answer)

        # Generate podcast
        status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(nb.id)
        await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb.id, status.task_id)

asyncio.run(main())
Agent Skills (Claude Code)

# Install via CLI or ask Claude Code to do it
notebooklm skill install

# Then use natural language:
# "Create a podcast about quantum computing"
# "Download the quiz as markdown"
# "/notebooklm generate video"
